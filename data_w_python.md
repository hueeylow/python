<h1>Visualise Data with Python</h1>
<p>Visualizing data with Python is a powerful way to transform raw numbers into meaningful insights. With versatile libraries such as Matplotlib, Seaborn, and Plotly, it is easy to create charts, graphs, and interactive dashboards that reveal trends and patterns. In this illustration, I will use Health Supplement Sales Dataset from Kaggle, to visualize the sales performance of a health company, highlighting key insights that can support data-driven decisions.</p>

<p>Null data is not found in the dataset, hence no data imputation is required. Let's plot the sales trend from Y2020 to Y2024. </p>
