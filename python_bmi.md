# Python Project Demo - Body Mass Index (BMI) Indicator
Welcome to my python project demo! 

In this showcase, i have created a Body Mass Index (BMI) Indicator tool to gauge one's health status:

## <b> Approach </b><br>
(1) Import random (<- function to generate / manipulate numbers) <br>
(2) Declare variables: To store user keyed inputs of Height and Weight <br>
(3) Define calculation: BMI is a person's weight in kilograms divided by the square of height in meters.  <br>
(4) Set if/else conditions: Underweight / Normal Weight / Overweight / Obese <br>
(5) Execute to test run <br>

## <b> Executed Results </b>
It's time to test out the coding. After clicking 'Run Module' to execute the program, IDLE test environment will prompt for user's input susbequently (name, height, weight), and thereafter return results of the computed BMI and remarks on health status. <br>
#### Result 1 - Underweight

#### Result 2 - Normal Weight

#### Result 3 - Overweight

#### Result 4 - Obese
