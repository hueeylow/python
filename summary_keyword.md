The project focus in this demo will illustrate the following: <br>  <br>
(1) Job skills compatibility match <br>
(2) Extract keyword from a job candidate's profile summary
<br>
<br>

I have created 2 sample word doc files: <br>
<br>

  <b> (2) Extract keyword from a job candidate's profile summary</b><br>
  <br> Using Rake function splits the text into a list of words, removing stop words from the same list. In other words, it drop word(s) off from the sentence which does not add meaning to it.

These 2 functions can be helpful in performing data collation and scanning when dealing with large volume of data processing work.
