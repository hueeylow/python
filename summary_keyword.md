# Keyword Match & Extraction using Python
<br>
The project focus in this demo will illustrate the following: <br>  <br>
(1) Job skills compatibility match <br>
(2) Extract keyword from a job candidate's profile summary
<br>
<br>
<b> (1) Job skills compatibility match </b><br>
I have created 2 sample word doc files: <br>
<br>

- Candidate's Profile Summary:<br>

- Job Essential Skills:<br>

  <b> (2) Extract keyword from a Job Candidate's Profile Summary</b><br>
  <br> Using Rake() function splits the text into a list of words, removing stop words from the same list. It drop off word(s) from the sentence which does not add meaning to it.

The above keyword match and text extraction can bring better efficiency to work processes that requires to perform narrow filtering and analysis over large volume of data.
